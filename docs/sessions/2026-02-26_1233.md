# Session: 2026-02-26_1233

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.6

## Focus
Figma MCP scope fix and email template design roundtrip prep.

## What Was Done
- Verified Figma MCP tools are connected and authenticated this session
- Discovered Figma MCP was configured at `local` scope (project `.claude.json`) — only available in MollyMemo
- Moved Figma MCP to `user` scope (`~/.claude/settings.json`) so it's available across all projects
- Commands: `claude mcp remove figma` then `claude mcp add -s user -t http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`

## Commits
None — configuration-only session.

## Tech Debt Identified
None

## CLAUDE.md Updates Needed
None

## Next Session

### Suggested Focus
**Figma MCP email template roundtrip** — Figma MCP is now user-scoped and authenticated. Start a new session (needed for scope change to take effect), verify Figma tools load, then:
1. User provides a Figma file URL with the email template design
2. Use `get_design_context` / `get_screenshot` to pull the design
3. Polish `src/lib/email.ts` HTML template to match the Figma design

If no Figma file exists yet, user should create one first in Figma.

If the Figma roundtrip isn't the priority, next features are:
- Feature #3 (Chrome Extension) — MOL-26 → MOL-34
- Feature #4 (Visual Refresh) — MOL-35 → MOL-42

### Key Files
- `src/lib/email.ts` — HTML email template to polish via Figma design
- `~/.claude/settings.json` — where Figma MCP is now configured (user scope)

### Kickoff Message
Figma MCP is now user-scoped in `~/.claude/settings.json` (moved from project-level `.claude.json`). Restart connected it. User wants a design roundtrip: pull design from Figma → regenerate the email template HTML in `src/lib/email.ts`. User needs to have a Figma file URL ready with the email template design. If Figma tools still don't connect, check `claude mcp list` and re-add if needed. Resend integration is fully operational.

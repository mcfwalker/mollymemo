## Focus
Build LazyList v0.1 - personal knowledge capture system

## What Was Done
- Designed full architecture (capture → process → store → query)
- Created Supabase project + items table with indexes
- Built Next.js app with capture API, items API, and web UI
- Implemented TikTok processor: tikwm → video download → ElevenLabs transcription
- Implemented GitHub processor: metadata via GitHub API
- Built AI classifier (switched from Gemini to OpenAI GPT-4o mini due to quota issues)
- Added password protection for web UI
- Deployed to Vercel with custom domain lazylist.mcfw.io
- Upgraded to Vercel Pro for 60s function timeout (TikTok processing needs it)
- Created `/lazylist` Claude Code skill for querying captured knowledge
- Successfully tested full pipeline: TikTok → transcript → classification → stored

## Tech Debt Identified
- [ ] Article processor not implemented yet - Low
- [ ] No retry logic for failed API calls - Low
- [ ] Duplicate detection only checks last 24h - Low

## CLAUDE.md Updates Needed
None - CLAUDE.md is up to date

## Next Session

### Suggested Focus
Complete iOS Shortcut setup for phone capture. The shortcut is partially configured - need to:
1. Change input type from "Apps and 18 more" to just "URLs"
2. Add "Get Contents of URL" action with POST to capture endpoint
3. Add notification action
4. Test end-to-end from phone

### Key Files
- `src/app/api/capture/route.ts` - Capture endpoint (POST with Bearer auth)
- `~/.claude/skills/lazylist/SKILL.md` - Query skill for Claude Code
- iOS Shortcuts app - Partially configured shortcut

### Kickoff Message
LazyList v0.1 is fully functional. Web UI at lazylist.mcfw.io (password protected). TikTok and GitHub capture working. iOS Shortcut is partially set up in Shortcuts app on Mac - need to change input type to URLs only, then add the POST action to `https://lazylist.mcfw.io/api/capture` with Bearer token `c120662155cad975d034847218a0e06b066c66106a8ca7bc5a1314c468dd6df`. After shortcut is done, test by sharing a link from phone.

# Session: 2026-01-26_1642

## Focus
Made capture async for instant response + built LazyList Desktop macOS app.

## What Was Done
- **Async capture:** Removed `await` from `processItem()` in capture route - iOS Shortcut and desktop app now return instantly
- **LazyList Desktop app:** Built native macOS SwiftUI app for URL capture
  - Keychain storage for API key (secure)
  - Simple paste → Enter workflow
  - Custom app icon (black beans)
  - Lives in /Applications, dockable
- **Codebase audit:** Completed post-Grok integration audit (earlier in session)
- **Feature requests:** Documented YouTube, cost tracking, contrast fix, universal capture

## New Project Created
- **lazylist-desktop** at `~/Development/mcfw/lazylist-desktop`
- Local git only (no remote)
- SwiftUI macOS app with Keychain integration

## Tech Debt Identified

## CLAUDE.md Updates Needed
None - lazylist-desktop is a separate project.

## Next Session

### Suggested Focus
**Yellow contrast fix** - Audit all yellow color usage in lazylist web app and fix for WCAG compliance on light theme. Quick visual polish win.

**Or YouTube support** - Add YouTube processor following the TikTok pattern. Check for existing captions via YouTube API before transcribing to save costs.

### Key Files
- `src/app/globals.css` - CSS variables including yellow colors
- `src/components/ItemCard.tsx` - May have yellow usage
- `docs/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` - Full backlog with YouTube implementation notes
- `src/lib/processors/tiktok.ts` - Pattern to follow for YouTube

### Kickoff Message
LazyList now has instant capture (async) and a native macOS desktop app. The web app has a yellow text contrast issue on light theme that needs fixing. Check `docs/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` for the full v0.2 backlog. Desktop app is at `~/Development/mcfw/lazylist-desktop` (local git only).

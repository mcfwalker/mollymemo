# Session: 2026-01-31_1759

## Focus
Strategic planning for MollyMemo v2 — designed the interest graph architecture and wrote comprehensive implementation plan.

## What Was Done
- Compared claude-mem (external memory plugin) against MollyMemo's current session notes approach
- Analyzed MollyMemo's existing roadmap and identified alignment with interest graph vision
- Identified retrieval gap: ILIKE keyword search can't handle semantic queries ("reddit scraping" vs "scans Reddit")
- Designed interest graph architecture with user at center — structured interests for explainability, item embeddings for semantic search
- Wrote comprehensive implementation plan covering 4 phases:
  - Phase 1: Embeddings foundation (pgvector, embedding service, backfill)
  - Phase 2: Interest graph (user_interests table, extraction, weighting/decay)
  - Phase 3: Proactive discovery (HN Algolia search, memos table, digest integration)
  - Phase 4: Real-time pings (optional, for high-relevance discoveries)

## Next Session

### Suggested Focus
Execute Phase 1 of the interest graph plan: enable pgvector, create embedding service, integrate into item processing, and backfill existing items.

### Key Files
- `docs/plans/2026-01-31-interest-graph-v2.md` — The full implementation plan
- `src/inngest/functions/process-item.ts` — Where embedding generation will be added
- `src/lib/embeddings.ts` — New file to create
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — Reference for existing feature plans

### Kickoff Message
MollyMemo v2 plan is written and committed. Start with Phase 1: enable pgvector extension in Supabase, create the embedding service at `src/lib/embeddings.ts`, integrate embedding generation into the item processing pipeline, then backfill the existing 88 items. The plan has step-by-step TDD instructions — use `superpowers:executing-plans` to work through it task by task.

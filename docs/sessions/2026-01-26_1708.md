## Focus
Fixed yellow text contrast issue and set up Linear project tracking with workspace-scoped MCP configuration.

## What Was Done
- **Yellow contrast fix:** Updated CSS to use foreground color variants for text elements (item numbers, stars, language labels, status badges). Contrast improved from ~1:1 to ~5:1 (WCAG AA compliant).
- **Linear project setup:** Created LazyList project in Linear with 7 issues for tech debt and features
  - Realized Linear MCP was connected to wrong workspace (Valeron instead of mcfwalker)
  - Archived the incorrectly-created issues in Valeron
- **Linear MCP reconfiguration:** Set up workspace-scoped Linear MCP configs
  - Added `linear-mcfwalker` to `/Development/mcfw/.mcp.json`
  - Added `linear-valeron` to `/Development/valeron/.mcp.json`
  - Uninstalled the user-level Linear plugin
  - Uses community `mcp-server-linear` package with Personal API Keys
- **Feature requests updated:** Marked yellow contrast (#6) and async capture (#7) as done

## Next Session

### Suggested Focus
**Re-create Linear issues in mcfwalker workspace.** After restarting Claude Code, the new Linear MCP should connect to mcfwalker. Re-create the LazyList project and issues:
- 2 Tech Debt: component tests, grok.ts tests
- 5 Features: YouTube support, cost tracking, new domains, Telegram capture, repo metadata

### Key Files
- `/Development/mcfw/.mcp.json` - Linear mcfwalker MCP config (API key in place)
- `docs/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` - Source of truth for issues to create
- Previous session log for issue details

### Kickoff Message
Yellow contrast fix is deployed. Linear MCP was reconfigured for workspace isolation - mcfwalker workspace should now be accessible after restart. Need to re-create the LazyList project and 7 issues in the correct Linear workspace. All issue details were documented earlier in this session.

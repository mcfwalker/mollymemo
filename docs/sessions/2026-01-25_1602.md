## Focus
UI polish: login page redesign, theme updates, cleanup

## What Was Done
- Cleaned up ElevenLabs/Gemini references (switched to OpenAI last session)
- Removed debug console.logs from tiktok processor
- Deleted RepoRipper source code (`_mcfw_workspace/repos/`)
- Redesigned login page:
  - Replaced video with static image (memory: 309MB → minimal)
  - Side-by-side layout: image left, login right on desktop
  - Stacks vertically on mobile
  - Fixed viewport coverage with `position: fixed`
- Installed notebook theme (grayscale, Architects Daughter font)
- Fixed link contrast (was yellow on white, now uses primary color)
- Created FEATURE_REQUESTS.md for tracking enhancements

## Tech Debt Identified
- [ ] Links still need better differentiation (underline or orange) - Medium
- [ ] Extracted GitHub repos not surfaced in UI - Medium

## CLAUDE.md Updates Needed
None - already updated AI stack to OpenAI last commit

## Next Session

### Suggested Focus
Address link visibility (feature request #1) - add underlines or change to orange color. Then surface extracted GitHub repos in item cards.

### Key Files
- `src/app/globals.css` - Link styles (currently uses `--primary`)
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main item list, needs to display `extracted_entities.repos`
- `docs/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` - Tracked feature requests
- `src/lib/processors/classifier.ts` - If adding new domains

### Kickoff Message
LazyList login page is now using a static image with side-by-side layout (image left, login right). Notebook theme installed with Architects Daughter font. Two feature requests pending: (1) improve link visibility with underlines or contrasting color, (2) surface extracted GitHub repos in the item card UI. The extraction already works and stores URLs in `extracted_entities.repos`.

## Focus
Feature requests: link visibility, GitHub repo extraction, UI polish

## What Was Done
- Implemented orange link colors with theme-friendly `--link`/`--link-hover` variables
- Surfaced extracted GitHub repos in expanded item card details
- Added AI extraction of repo names from transcripts (GPT-4o mini + GitHub search)
- Backfilled 5 existing TikTok items with GitHub repo URLs
- UI polish:
  - Login title "dont log in" (added space)
  - Widened login form to match title width
  - Increased font sizes: title 16px, summary/details/transcript 14px
  - Fixed summary contrast (was muted gray, now uses --text)
  - Repo links use Architects Daughter font (not monospace)

## Next Session

### Suggested Focus
Add delete and edit UI for items. Both are low effort - delete needs button + API endpoint, edit just needs UI since PATCH endpoint exists.

### Key Files
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main item list, add delete/edit buttons
- `src/app/api/items/[id]/route.ts` - Add DELETE handler (PATCH exists)
- `src/app/page.module.css` - Styles for new buttons
- `docs/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` - Track new features

### Kickoff Message
LazyList now has orange links, GitHub repo extraction (AI-powered), and improved typography. Two features queued: (1) delete item button with API endpoint, (2) edit title UI (PATCH endpoint already exists at `/api/items/:id`). Also consider LLM auto-correcting titles when repo name differs from transcript. "SplitInk" item still needs manual fix to "Splitting".

# Session: 2026-02-26_1227

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.6

## Focus
Set up Figma MCP for email template design roundtrip.

## What Was Done
- Confirmed `RESEND_API_KEY` is already added to Vercel (user confirmed "resend is done")
- Attempted Figma MCP roundtrip for email template polish
- Discovered Figma MCP server was not persisted from prior session — not in `~/.claude/settings.json` or `~/.claude/.mcp.json`
- Re-added Figma MCP server: `claude mcp add figma --transport http https://mcp.figma.com/mcp` — saved to local project config (`/Users/matthewwalker/.claude.json`)
- MCP servers added mid-session don't connect until restart — session ended to allow reconnection

## Commits

## Tech Debt Identified

## Next Session

### Suggested Focus
**Figma MCP design roundtrip** — the Figma MCP server is now configured in the local project config. Start a new session, verify the Figma tools are available, then:
1. Pull design tokens or components from a Figma file (user needs to provide a Figma file URL with the email template design)
2. Use the design to polish `src/lib/email.ts` HTML template
3. If no Figma file exists yet, user should create one first in Figma, then return

If the Figma roundtrip isn't the priority, the next MollyMemo features are:
- Feature #3 (Chrome Extension) — `next` horizon
- Feature #4 (Visual Refresh) — `next` horizon

### Key Files
- `src/lib/email.ts` — HTML email template to polish via Figma design
- `.claude.json` (project root) — where Figma MCP was added

### Kickoff Message
Figma MCP server is now configured in the local project `.claude.json`. Restart connected it. User wants a design roundtrip: pull design from Figma → regenerate the email template HTML in `src/lib/email.ts`. User needs to have a Figma file URL ready with the email template design. If Figma tools still don't connect, check `claude mcp list` and re-add if needed. Resend integration is fully operational.
